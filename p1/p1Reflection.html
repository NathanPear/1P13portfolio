            <p>During the beginning of the project I was singularly focused on the problem solving process however this strategy resulted in uncoordinated ineffective work. What I failed to account for is the fact that a group project requires skills outside of just engineering to be successful. Specifically I failed to focus on communicating effectively with my team while working, and participating in deciding what direction the project should take. After our group floundered for a couple weeks I realized my mistake and started putting more effort into effective communication with my teammates and taking a more active role in leading the team. Before we were all just doing our own tasks but as our effective communication increased our collaborative work became more efficient and easier to integrate.</p>

            <p>While working on the project I found that problem solving and making decisions came very easy for me but documenting and justifying those decisions did not. Throughout the project I experimented with different documentation and communication strategies such as setting up templates to fill in later, or just documenting all my work at the end but I found that documenting my work as I go was the most effective strategy for maintaining good documentation and recording my justifications for my design choices.</p>

            <p>If I had to redo this project from the start I would put more effort into actively participating in team discourse, take a leadership role earlier on, and document my work as I go. First, focusing equally on soft skills like communication and leadership and technical skills like problem solving earlier on the project could have been completed with less work because of the better efficiency of the team. Second, documenting my work as I went would have led to me creating significantly better documentation and would have helped me to better justify my design choices to my teammates. In the future I plan to focus both on putting more effort into the social aspects of group work to become a more effective engineer</p>
